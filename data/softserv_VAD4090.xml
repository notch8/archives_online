      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame, Inc. (BFHFI) was founded in Oakland, California in 1974.
        The BFHFI began as a collaboration among Roy Thomas from the Afro-American Studies
        Department at UC-Berkeley, Mary Perry Smith, who was the co-chairperson of the Cultural and
        Ethnic Affairs Guild and at the Oakland Museum, and Sonny Buxton of the San Francisco Bay
        Area station KGO-TV.</p>
      <p> The BFHFI identified itself as an organization "dedicated to influencing Black images
        portrayed in film and television through education, the nurturing of current independent
        filmmakers and the preservation of contributions by Black artists" (BFHFI 20th Anniversary
        Celebration Program). Throughout its existence the BFHFI presented award ceremonies honoring
        contemporary and historic figures in black filmmaking. Notable programs established by the
        BFHFI include the Oscar Micheaux Awards Ceremony, the International Black Film, Video &amp;
        Screenplay Competition, the Black Filmworks International Film Festival, and the Sidney
        Poitier Fellowship. Additionally, educational programs, various symposia, and lecture series
        on black film were conducted throughout the life of the organization.</p>
      <p> The BFHFI initially operated in partnership with the Oakland Museum, later incorporating
        itself as an independent, non-profit organization in 1978. Attempts to establish a dedicated
        museum and permanent home for the BFHFI were ultimately unsuccessful, although the BFHFI did
        begin acquisition of collections for this proposed museum.</p>
      <p> The final Oscar Micheaux Awards ceremony was held in 1993, the 20th anniversary of the
        founding of the event. The BFHFI continued to present the Black Filmworks International Film
        Festival and Black Independent Film, Video &amp; Screenplay Competition through 2003. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>This series consists of application materials submitted for consideration for the Sidney
        Poitier Fellowship (SPF) competition. The Sidney Poitier Fellowship for Emerging Black
        Filmmakers was announced by the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame, Inc. (BFHFI) in 1992 as a
        program to award up to ten fellowships to black film/video artists in the process of
        beginning or completing projects. The SPF program sought to "discover and provide support to
        talented persons who are pursuing careers as video and film makers" and to further the
        BFHFI's mission to provide resources to "those who are creating new and dynamic media images
        from our cultural perspective" (BFHFI planning document). The BFHFI announced the first
        Poitier Fellowship winners, who were selected from a pool of 102 applicants, at its 20th and
        final Oscar Micheaux Awards Ceremony in October 1993. The Awards Ceremony souvenir program
        includes a listing of the Poitier Fellowship awardees. Although the BFHFI intended to
        present ten awards bi-annually, the Sidney Poitier Fellowship program did not continue after
        its initial year.</p>
      <p> SPF applicants were required to submit budgets, treatments, scripts, or project proposals,
        as well as a sample work on videocassette. The applications reflect a broad spectrum of
        independent film and video making from the early 1990s. Proposals include feature films,
        film school student projects, documentaries, community television, animation, experimental
        short films, and new media productions submitted by applicants ranging from first-time
        filmmakers to experienced mid-career veterans.</p>
      <p> Videocassettes included with applications have been arranged in a separate series. Except
        when unavailable, each application has a corresponding sample work on videocassette found in
        the Videocassettes Series</p>

      <head>Related Material</head>
      <p>For some works-in-progress, another version of the production was submitted to the BFHFI
        for its regular Independent Film, Video, &amp; Screenplay Competition or other BFHFI events.
        These alternate versions have been listed within the relevant series. When possible, the
        existence of an alternate version to an SPF entry has been noted, however this cross-listing
        is not comprehensive and researchers interested in studying multiple version of a specific
        work are advised to perform additional keyword searches within "Series 4. Black Filmworks
        and Independent Film, Video &amp; Screenplay Competition."</p>

            <p>SPF applicants were required to submit project proposals as well as project budgets
              detailing funding sought from the BFHFI. Many applications include complete scripts,
              while others provide treatments or storyboards. Other supplementary material commonly
              found in application packets include press clippings, résumés, and letters of
              recommendation. Sample works on videocassette included with submissions are identified
              in the supplemental content to the applications; however, these videocassettes are
              arranged and described separately in the series Videocassette Submissions.</p>
            <p> The items listed under "Originally Submitted Supplemental Content" are those
              indicated by the applicant as having originally been submitted to the BFHFI. In some
              cases materials described in this section were returned to the applicant by the BFHFI
              and are not held by BFC/A. This has been indicated where possible.</p>
            <p> Except when unavailable, evaluation forms completed by the five judges, including
              comments and responses to proposals and sample works, are filed with the application
              packets.</p>
            <p> Arrangement of the series follows the entry numbering system the BFHFI assigned to

            <p>Sidney Poitier Fellowship (SPF) applicants were asked to submit a 15-minute sample
              work on a VHS videocassette. Video submissions vary in content from portions of the
              work-in-progress proposed in the SPF application to previously completed works to
              compilation reels. Applicants were offered the choice to have videocassettes returned
              after judging, and for many applications in this series no video submission is
              held.</p>
            <p> Videocassettes listed in this series were received with SPF application materials.
              For some works-in-progress, a later version of the production was later submitted to
              the BFHFI. A separate inventory of videocassettes submitted to other BFHFI
              competitions, which includes these later versions, may be found in "Series 4. Black
              Filmworks &amp; the annual BFHFI Independent Film, Video &amp; Screenplay Competition,
